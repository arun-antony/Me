  <h2>Timeline:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Learning stared on 7 August 2023 with basics or intro to DS</li>
  
  </ol>

  <h2>Main points</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Intro to DS</li>
    <ol>
      <li> What is DS? It can be defined as arrangement of data in memory so that a program could execute the code on some data most efficiently.
        A program needs data for it to work. So without DS, a program cannot exist. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Memory is allocated to a program for its execution. When a program is started, it is allocated 3 sections. Code section, stack and heap.
      </li>
      <li>
        Code Section: Program executable or machine level code is brought to code section of RAM when a program is started.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stack: Static allocated memory. For each function that is started are allocated memory in stack - called as Stackframe or Activation record. So the memory known at
        compile time is allocated here. This area can be directly accessed by the code. Primary variables, pointers etc are allocated here. References to Dynamicaly allocated memory locations
        and resources are present here.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heap: Dynamically allocated memory: Arrays, Linked list etc are allocated and deallocated on demand.
      </li>
      <li>
        Monolithic programming: All code written in a single function. Not reusable and inneficient
      </li>
      <li>
        Procedural or Modular programming: Split into multiple functions, classes - modular, reusable, maintainable
      </li>
      <li>
        Interesting Fact in C++: Code that uses references become inline - no separate memory is allocated in stack - it becomes part of code section.
      </li>
      <li>
        Call by value: Copies of variable are passed. <br/>
        Call by reference: References are passed. So the function works on the same copy of variables. Such fns become inline. No separate activation records allocated. <br/>
        Call by address: Pointers are passed. A pointer memory is allocated for the function in its Activation record. <br/>
      </li>

      <li>
        Physical vs Logical Data Structures: <br/>

        Physical DS: They define how the memory is organized: Arrays (if size id known), Linked List (if size is not known upfront). <br/>
        Logical DS: They are DS derived or created using physical DS. 
        Eg: <br/> 
        1. Stack - LIFO , Queue - FIFO  - Linear DS <br/>
        2. Graph, Tree - Non Linear DS <br/>
        3. HashTable - Linear/Non-Linear/Tabular DS <br/>

        <br/>
        ADT - Abstract Datatypes: Definition of data, Operations on Data : Impl details are abstract eg: Class

    </ol>
    <br>
    <li><b>Complexities</b></li>
    <ol>
      <li>Time Complexity: Representation of time required for exectution of a piece of code. It is represented as <i>(n<sup>deg</sup>)</sup></i></li>
      <li>Space Complexity: Representaton of space or memory used for execution of a piece of code.</li>

             class User{

               String userName;

               User(){

               }
             }
            
          </code>
