    <h1>Complexity</h1>
    <hr size="3" noshade>

    <h2>Time Complexity:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Measure of time required to execute a code.</li>
      <li>Represented using Big O notation : O(n<sup>deg)</sup>. Order of deg</li> 
      <li>If the code is represented as a function of f(n), then the complexity is the degree of the polynomial f(n)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Examples</h3>

    <h4>Case 1: Complexity for code with a simple function with no loop is O(1) or const</h4>
    <p>Code which does some operation that has no repetition. A simple addition function.</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        
      int sum(int a, int b){

          int sum = a+b; //Executes 1 time
          
          return sum; //Executes 1 time
          
      }

      //The number of executions for above function can be represented as f(n) = 2
      //So the complexity is degree of f(n) which is 0
      //Hence the complexity is O(n<sup>0</sup>) which is same as O(1)
        
      </code>
    </pre>

    <h4>Case 2: Complexity for code with a single depth loop is O(n) </h4>
    <p>A function which iterates through a single dimension array and does some operation.<br/>
      Complexity is for worst case scenario is when it goes all the way to the end of the array.<br/>
    
    If there are multiple loops in a function that are <em>NOT NESTED</em>, the complexity will be still the same.</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        
      int sum(int array[]){

          int sum = 0; //Executes 1 time
          int n = array.size(); //Execute 1 time
          for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++){
              sum += array[i]; //Executes 'n' times
          }
          return sum; //Executes 1 time

      }

      //The number of executions for above function can be represented as f(n) = n+3
      //So the complexity is degree of f(n) which is 1
      //Hence the complexity is O(n<sup>1</sup>) which is same as O(n)
        
      </code>
    </pre>

    <h4>Case 3: Complexity for code with a nested depth loop is O(n<sup>num of nesting</sup>) </h4>
    <p>A function which iterates through a matrix and does some operation.<br/>Or iterates through an array and for each item, iterates through every item in that array </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        
      int sum(int array[]){

          int sum = 0; //Executes 1 time
          int n = array.size(); //Execute 1 time
          for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++){ //Executes 'n' times
             
            for(int j = 0; j&lt;n; j++){ //Executes 'n*n' times
               //Does some operation
            }
          }
          return sum; //Executes 1 time

      }

      //The number of executions for above function can be represented as f(n) = n<sup>2</sup>+n+3
      //So the complexity is degree of f(n) which is 2
      //Hence the complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>)
